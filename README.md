# Ionic PMF at graphene interface and confined water dielectric response. 

This code is used in https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.08779.pdf and in my PhD thesis. It can be refined to include the RPA calculation from the metallic part. I give the material to do so. 

Just make in the src folder after linking the LAPACK and BLAS libraries. Then execute ./main in the root folder containing the input file.
