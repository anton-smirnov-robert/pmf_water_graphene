# pmf_water_graphene

This code is used in https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.08779.pdf. It can be refined to include the RPA calculation from the metallic part. I give the material to do so. 
Just make in the src folder after linkinng the LAPACK and BLAS libraries. Then execute ./main in the root folder containing the input file.
